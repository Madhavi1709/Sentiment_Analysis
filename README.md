# 📊 Sentiment Analysis of Text Using NLP & Machine Learning

## 🔍 Project Overview
This project performs **sentiment analysis on user-provided text** and classifies it as  
**Positive**, **Negative**, or **Neutral** using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and  
**Machine Learning (Logistic Regression)**.

The system includes a **web-based landing page** where users can enter text and instantly
view the predicted sentiment.

## ⚙️ How the System Works
1. User enters text through the web interface  
2. Text is preprocessed (tokenization, stop-word removal, lemmatization)  
3. TF-IDF Vectorization converts text into numerical features  
4. Logistic Regression model predicts sentiment  
5. Result is displayed on the UI with color-coded feedback
